Ghost Buster
============

This package provides an easier way to work with existential data types. 
Normally, GHC will reject types with deeply nested `forall`s in them.
This package uses a data contructor to hide that away, so you can nest as deeply as you like.

Example code is in `src/Data/SuchThat/Example.hs`.
